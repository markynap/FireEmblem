Guy:Hey! I just helped you guys fight
Guy:You should let me board your ship.
Nino-Ike:He did help me out during battle.
Ike-Guy:I saw your efforts. Why do you wish to board?
Guy-Ike:I've been following you, I hear you are storming
Guy-Ike:the Daharan Armory.
Guy-Ike:Cut me in on the profits, and I will lend my sword
Ike-Guy:We cannot physically carry out everything
Ike-Guy:in that armory, and we need all the help we can get.
Ike-Guy:You're in, you may take whatever you can carry
Ike-Guy:from the Armory, we will not be returning.
Ike-Guy:Right after the Armory we storm the Imperial Office
Ike-Guy:on the eastern shore of Dahara. If we can defeat
Ike-Guy:General Raul and control access to the east river,
Ike-Guy:It's only a matter of time before Dahara falls
Ike:I will rule Dahara! I will destroy all injustice
Ike:It will be mine!
Guy:...

Hector:.....
Kent:. . . .
Guy-Ike:I'll just stay until we clear the Armory.
