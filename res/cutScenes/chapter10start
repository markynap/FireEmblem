Hector-Bard:Are you sure this is the right way?
Bard-Hector:No, but it is the correct general direction.
Hector:Lost in Middle-East Dahara.. Great.
Marcus-Hector:Do not fret my Lord,
Marcus-Hector:You have several able fighters here alongside you.
Hector-Marcus:Three less than we had before.
Hector-Marcus:Three less strong fighters and healers.
Hector-Marcus:Why did that Wyvern Rider follow them anyway?
Marcus-Hector:Not sure, I never got to speak with him.
Hector:Anyone have any idea what to do next?
Kent-Hector:We need more hands if we are to fight Raul.
Kent-Hector:I hate to say it, but we might need Ostian aid.
Hector-Kent:No, unacceptable. We will finish this without my brother.
Marcus-Hector:My Lord.. It may be our only option.
Marcus-Hector:If we really wish to storm Daharan Fortresses,
Marcus-Hector:we will need the aid of your brother's soldiers
Marcus-Hector:if we hope to survive long enough to reach the throne.
Hector:My brother is a narcissistic bastard.
Hector:I will not beg him for support.
Marcus-Hector:Then allow me to ask. I have served King Ostia
Marcus-Hector:faithfully for twelve years.
Marcus-Hector:He will not hesitate to grant me this wish.
Marcus-Hector:He sent me all this way to keep you safe after all
Hector-Marcus:That's because he likes to rub in the fact
Hector-Marcus:That he has more power than me
Hector-Marcus:More people to do his bidding than me.
Hector-Marcus:But I cannot allow my personal feelings toward him
Hector-Marcus:to stand in the way of our mission..
Hector:Everybody! We have fought long and hard
Hector:But we cannot defeat Dahara on our own.
Hector:We must travel to Ostia, in seek of my brother's help.
Hector:There we will find men to help us take down Raul!
Hector:The road to Ostia is dangerous and filled with patrols
Hector:Everybody stay sharp and follow Marcus and I.
