Ike-Nino: Oh thank the spirits you are safe!
Nino-Ike: It was awful big brother! They fed us day old bread.
Ike-Nino: You're with us now, I'm not letting you out of sight.
Nino-Ike: Teehee, I knew you'd rescue me!

Ike-Bard: Yes, and you're welcome. How did you end up there?
Bard-Ike:King Nergal grew tired of my dancing and wanted
Bard-Ike:To find someone more youthful and high-spirited.
Bard-Ike:I was once the king's favorite dancer...
Bard-Ike:I had access to restricted areas in Castle Hrothgar.
Bard-Ike:Due to this benefit, however, I was a liability to

Ike-Bard:We are trying to put an end to Nergal's rule over Dahara.

Raymond: GAHH, why such a long journey?!?
Ike-Bard: Ray is fine, we head to Castle Hrothgar at once!

Kent-Raymond: ....
