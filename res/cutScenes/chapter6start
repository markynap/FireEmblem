Ike-Bard:I'm surprised it's all funded by piracy.
Bard-Ike:Nobody questions it, everything is just paid for.
Ike-Bard:So who do we talk to to gain passage on a ship?
Bard-Ike:I believe the Minister Alfred is the head of
Bard-Ike:the group of pirates, everybody listens to him.
Bard-Ike:Alfred will not just let anybody pass
Bard-Ike:First we must prove our mettle through combat.
Ike-Bard:We have to fight them?
Bard-Ike:If we can get as far as to incapacitate Alfred
Bard-Ike:We will gain the respect needed to board.
Ike:Alright team, you heard the Dancer.
Ike:We need to reach Alfred and defeat him
Ike:In order to gain access to his boat.
Ike:Prepare for combat, bring your best equipment
Ike:This is the closest we have come to the Armory!
