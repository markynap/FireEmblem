Ike:Alright we've made it to the Village of Scantucky
Ike:We are just here to gather supplies from villages
Ike:Maybe visit the armory too if you are low on weapons.
Wolf-Ike:These people look friendly, why are we stealing?
Ike-Wolf:We are not stealing, the people of Scantucky hate
Ike-Wolf:The Daharans as much as any of us, they will willingly
Ike-Wolf:Give us equipment if we visit their individual villages
Ike-Wolf:We are not thieves or pillagers, that would make us
Ike-Wolf:Just as bad as the Daharans themselves.
Wolf-Ike:Wait a minute, I think the Daharans had our same idea
Ike-Wolf:No! Daharans moving in, quickly get into positions!
Ike:If only Hector and Kent were here to help us..
