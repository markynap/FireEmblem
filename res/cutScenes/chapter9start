Ike:Where's the boat!?
Hector-Ike:Damn Pirates must have took off without us.
Bard-Hector:Can't be, their code of conduct won't allow it.
Kent-Hector:Maybe they were lured away by mermaids!
Ike:Everybody stop talking!
Ike-Hector:Hector, How do we get off this island?
Kahlan-Ike:There is one way, but it takes us west.
Kahlan-Ike:I'm not sure if the bridges have withstood
Kahlan-Ike:these raging waves for very long though..
Ike-Kahlan:Wherever we land I can probably find us horses
Ike-Kahlan:to take us back around the island.
Ike:I don't see another option, we head west!
