Ike-Wolf:Thank you, friend, you came just in time.
Wolf-Ike:Same to the six of you, if you had not come
Wolf-Ike:Those damn bandits would have taken everything.
Ike-Wolf:It's dangerous here around Daharan territory
Ike-Wolf:How about you travel with us, we are going
Ike-Wolf:To hit the Daharans where it hurts. To start
Ike-Wolf:We are traveling to the Daharan Armory to raid
Ike-Wolf:It and use their weapons and gold against them.
Wolf-Ike:Say no more, I hope my bow will aid you well
Hector-Ike:Ike, I have some personal matters to attend to
Hector-Ike:I will join back up with you soon, but for now
Hector-Ike:I am bringing Kent with me, it is far too dangerous
Hector-Ike:to go alone, I hope you understand
Ike-Hector:Alright, try not to be gone too long cause we will
Ike-Hector:be headed straight for the Armory!
Ike:If anyone else wants to leave, now is the time
Hector-Ike:I-I'm not leaving, I just have to go for a few days
Ike:Fine. Press onward, Soldiers, we have stuff to do and
Ike:the Daharans will not just sit around and wait for us
