Bard-Ike:Now, we shouldn't waste more time.
Bard-Ike:We need to go to the Armory.
Ike-Bard:I thought that was the plan all along?
Bard-Ike:Yes but.. We need a boat.
Ike-Bard:A boat!?!
Bard-Ike:Yes, the Armory is on an island due east of here.
Ike-Bard:Where will we find a boat to carry all of us over?
Bard-Ike:I know these Pirates
Bard-Ike:They used to be allied with Dahara.
Bard-Ike:However I believe they have recently cut ties like us
Bard-Ike:It may be our only option at reaching the Armory.
Ike-Bard:Alright, let's pay these Pirates a visit..
Ike:I do not trust a pirate as far as I can throw one
Ike:Do not let your guard down, pirates are
Ike:Masters of manipulation, once they see us weak
Ike:They will not hesitate to rob us blind.
